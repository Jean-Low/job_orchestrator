This simples job orchestrator receives an python code and runs it on a Lambda Enviroment.
Use the client, The REST Api was designed to be used with it.

There are some configurations on the upper part of the client scripts
The default accesspoint is : 18.222.233.223:5000

Run client.py with python3. Follow the instructions.

The 


A code for the jobs here needs to follow some guidelines

Put a code you want to run in a file, I recomend the "scripts" folder in this directory

The result of your job is the stdout of your code. so you want to print the values of most interest.

The client creates a input object for you
A input needs to be treated as Constants (Like DEFINE in C)
This happens because the keys on the input object are replaced by their velues in your code in the Lambda Exec enviroment

Example of input good pratice:

#--------------
myvar = int(MYVAR)
counter = 0
while(myvar > 0):
    print(myvar)
    myvar -= 1
#--------------

But this code wont work without a valid input, so make sute to configure it right on the client.
